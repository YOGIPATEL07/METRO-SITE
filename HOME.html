          The Polaroid Automatic 320 Camera was a popular instant camera model
          that was first introduced in 1969. It was part of the Polaroid Land
          Camera series and used the peel-apart instant film. The camera
          featured a folding rangefinder design and a built-in automatic
          exposure system, which made it easy for users to take pictures without
          having to manually adjust the settings

          The Polaroid SX-70 was a revolutionary instant camera that was first
          introduced in 1972. It was designed by Edwin Land and was the first
          instant camera to use Polaroid's integral instant film, which
          contained both the negative and the positive layers required for a
          finished photograph.

          its built-in automatic flash.
